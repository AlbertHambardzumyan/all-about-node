# Array Evolution

Before stating something about JavaScript array, lets recall what is an Array.

An array is a sequential collection of data storage locations. When one declares an array of 10 integers, the
 compiler sets aside enough memory to hold all 10 elements. If each integer requires four bytes, this declaration sets 
 aside 40 contiguous bytes of memory, as illustrated bellow.
