All about Node.js


## Introduction

Before I start describing anything, lets make sure you really need it.

* If you write awesome Node.js code, get a bunch of money and party after the work, you can skip this.
* If you write average Node.js code and you are happy with what you have, you can skip this.
* If you write shitty code, but you do not care about it at all, you can skip this.
* If you write shitty code, but you do not care because you think others are in a shit that you write shitty code, you
 can skip this.

Seems, you already can fly like a bird, and swim like a fish.


If you feel you need & want more than you know, then you are welcome. Note, these will literally eat your time as you
 get more and more involved. So, be ready for it.

All the topics will be around: `Node.js`, `V8`, and `libuv`.

Topics we consider:
* [Array evolution](https://github.com/AlbertHambardzumyan/all-about-node/blob/master/src/array-evalution/ARRAY_EVOLUTION.md)
